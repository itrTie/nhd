                            <p>At the time of the constitutional convention, there were federalists in favor of the constitution and anti-federalists against the constitution.&nbsp;While both groups of people wanted to protect liberties, they had different paths.&nbsp;The anti-federalists thought the constitution would give too much power to the federal government and weaken the states, therefore encroaching on our liberties.<br><br>The federalists and the anti-federalists needed a way to compromise, and the Bill of Rights was that.&nbsp;The constitution gave power to the federal government, while the Bill of Rights gave protection to the individual.<br><br>In June of 1789, James Madison proposed the Bill of Rights.&nbsp;This contained 17 amendments, but it got changed to only contain 12 by Congress.&nbsp;This removed the 5 that limited state's government.&nbsp;Five states (NY, RI, NC, VA, MA) only agreed to ratify the constitution on the promise that the bill of rights would follow insuring individual liberties.&nbsp;On October 2nd, 1789, this draft of the Bill of Rights was sent to all the states, and by December 15, 1791, 3/4 of the states agreed on 10 of these, which became known as the Bill of Rights.&nbsp;This was a great achievement in diplomacy.</p>

                            <p>In order to pass the Bill of Rights to add to the constitution a lot of debate, diplomacy and compromise were required.&nbsp;Two parties had conflicting ideas about the constitution and the Bill of Rights.&nbsp;The Federalists believed in a more powerful federal government, did not want the Bill of Rights,&nbsp;and liked the constitution as it was written.&nbsp;On the contrary, the Anti-Federalist wanted the Bill of Rights passed so less power went to the government and more liberties were granted to the people.&nbsp;Both groups gave speeches to congress, wrote essays and letters in newspapers.&nbsp; The Federalist Papers and the Anti-Federalist Papers were anonymous essays, almost a written debate, to express the groups opinions.<br><br>Another example of debate is the numerous letters between Jefferson and Madison.&nbsp;Madison was opposed to the Bill of Rights as he felt there was no real need for it.&nbsp;Jefferson was able to convince Madison that without the Bill of Rights the constitution would never get ratified.&nbsp; Realizing this, as an act of diplomacy, Madison then wrote the Bill of Rights and became one of its strongest advocates.<br><br>Another compromise was the amount of clauses in the bill of rights had to be reduced from 17 to 12.&nbsp;This was done to remove some of the power that the federal government held over the states.&nbsp;This also made more anti-federalists side with the Bill of Rights, as they believed in more power at the state level.&nbsp;<br><br>A final example of diplomacy was the fact that several states wouldn't ratify the constitution without the promise of the Bill of Rights following.&nbsp;Without the states agreeing, the constitution would not have been ratified.&nbsp;They would have had to redraft the entire constitution.&nbsp;This disagreement was solved by adding the Bill of Rights to the constitution, so that once the constitution was passed, the Bill of Rights would ensue immediately.<br><br>This impact of passing the Bill of Rights thus giving us The Freedom of the Press is that America is a country where the government doesn't control the media.&nbsp;Because of free press, news sources can post anything they want without repercussions from the government.&nbsp;This makes it much harder to find unbiased news sources, a big challenge in today's society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another impact of passing the Bill of Rights was that the founders didn't have to start over with a new constitution.&nbsp;If this had happened, there's the possibility that the country could have divided over this discourse.&nbsp;But instead America is a unified country.</p>
