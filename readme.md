## What is National History Day?
National History Day is a regional competition which is definitely not about history.
Participants have to make a documentary, website, paper, exhibit, or website.
I decided to make a website, and if you think I'm not going to code it myself you are crazy.

## Theme and Topic
Every year, there is a theme for National History Day.
This year, it is Debate and Diplomacy.
My topic is the Freedom of the Press.

# Submission
I am following all requirements for the site, but I don't know if coding it then uploading it is allowed.
The main website requirements are to build it on NHDWebCentral, to have a landing page with the following:

- Participant Name
- Entry Title
- Division
- Category
- Website Word Count
- Multimedia Length
- Process Paper Word Count

to have the website reflect your ability to use computers, 

## Page Structure
My page structure is as follows:
- index
- home
- people
    - wilkes
    - arthurlee
- censorship
- diplomacy
- sources
- files
