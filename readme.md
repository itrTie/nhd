## What is National History Day?
National History Day is a regional competition which is definitely not about history.
Participants have to make a documentary, website, paper, exhibit, or website.
I decided to make a website, and if you think I'm not going to code it myself you are crazy.

## Theme and Topic
Every year, there is a theme for National History Day.
This year, it is Debate and Diplomacy.
