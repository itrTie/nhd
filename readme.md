## Git Basics
### Read this if you want to suggest an edit.
At the top part of the repository page, below the navigation bar, there are 3 buttons on the right.

### Watch

Watch lets you be notified of updates on the repository.

Watch means you only get notified for @mentions and when participating.

Unwatch means you always get notified or you have selected custom settings.

Unignore means you never get any notifications for that repository.

### Star

Starring a repository is like liking a YouTube video, it shows your appreciation for it and you can keep it in an organised place.

### Fork

This clones the repository to your account, where you can suggest changes.

If it says "This branch is (number) commit(s) behind (original repository owner username):(forked branch).", press "Fetch upstream" and "Fetch and merge".
Then, make your changes.

To suggest changes, open the file you want to change.
Press the pencil icon on the top of the text box, then make your change.
At the bottom, press "Commit changes".

At this time, you will be redirected the edited file.
Press the repository name at the top, below the Octocat logo but to the right of the username at the very top.
At the top of the file list, on the left side it should say "This branch is (number) commit(s) ahead (original repository owner username):(forked branch)."
On the right of that, there will be a button labeled Contribute.
Press that, then press "Open pull request".
Now, you will be at a comparison page.  If everything looks right, press Create pull request on the right side of the blue box.

I will then get a notification, then I can review the changes and accept them.
Thank you for contributing!

###### Note that I will **not** be accepting pull requests unless it is a student or teacher at my school.

## What is National History Day?
National History Day is a regional competition which is definitely not about history.
Participants have to make a documentary, website, paper, exhibit, or website.
I decided to make a website, and if you think I'm not going to code it myself you are crazy.

## Theme and Topic
Every year, there is a theme for National History Day.
This year, it is Debate and Diplomacy.
My topic is the Freedom of the Press.

# Submission
I am following all requirements for the site, but I don't know if coding it then uploading it is allowed.
The main website requirements are to build it on NHDWebCentral, to have a landing page with the following:

- Participant Name
- Entry Title
- Division
- Category
- Website Word Count
- Multimedia Length
- Process Paper Word Count

to have the website reflect your ability to use computers, 

## Page Structure
My page structure is as follows:
- index
- home
- people
    - wilkes
    - arthurlee
- censorship
- diplomacy
- sources
- files
