        Wilkites
    </h3>
    <p>
        John Wilkes had many followers, called Wilkites.
        These people worked to remove laws on seditious libel, accusing the government of lying.

    <h3>
        The North Briton
    </h3>
    <p>
        The North Briton was a newspaper published by Wilkes (anonymous at the time), and it was an anti-government publication.
        This newspaper reached it's way to the colonies, where they had likeminded goals and became followers of Wilkes.
        The most notable American Wilkite was <a href="./arthurlee.html">Arthur Lee</a>.
        <br>
        The name was chosen to make fun of King George III's earl's heratige, and the paper itself was satire.
        The most famous issue was Issue no. 45, and that issue is the reason why Wilkes was not only thrown out of parliament, but also imprisoned.
        It critisized a speech where King George III praised the treaty ending the Seven Year's War.

    <h3>
        Dedication
    </h3>
    <p>
        Wilkes was dedicated to making life better for all Englishmen, so he decide that he would accept all punishments thrown at him.
        He didn't ever go for removing seditious libel laws, but did admit to creating The North Briton.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Court Battles
    </h3>
    <p>
        Wilkes had battled against King George in court to add protection from the siezure of private papers with an attempt to find evidence.
        While he didn't have anything to do with Free Press, this act let Wilkes get the followers that did remove seditious libel.
