        Wilkites
    </h3>
    <p>
        John Wilkes had many followers, called Wilkites.
        These people worked to remove laws on seditious libel, or speaking out against the government.
        While Wilkes never had anything to do with seditious libel in court, his followers did.

    <h3>
        The North Briton
    </h3>
    <p>
        The North Briton was a newspaper published by Wilkes (anonymous at the time), and it was an anti-government publication.
        This newspaper reached it's way to the colonies, where they had likeminded goals and became followers of Wilkes.
        The most notable American Wilkite was <a href="./arthurlee.html">Arthur Lee</a>.

    <h3>
        Court Battles
    </h3>
    <p>
        Wilkes had battled against King George in court to add protection from the siezure of private papers with an attempt to find evidence.
        While he didn't have anything to do with Free Press, this act let Wilkes get the followers that did remove seditious libel.
