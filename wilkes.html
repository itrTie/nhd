    <h3>
        Wilkites
    </h3>
    <p>
        John Wilkes had many followers, called Wilkites.
        These people worked to remove laws on seditious libel, or speaking out against the government.
        While Wilkes never had anything to do with seditious libel, his followers did.

    <h3>
        Court Battles
    </h3>
    <p>
        Wilkes had battled against King George in court to add protection from the siezure of private papers with an attempt to find evidence.
        While he didn't have anything to do with Free Press, this act let Wilkes get the followers that did remove seditious libel.

    <h3>
        Influence in America
    </h3>
    <p>
        While Wilkes didn't change any laws in America, he did influence <a href="./arthurlee.html">Arthur Lee</a> to work towards the freedom of the press.
        Lee was essentially the Wilkes of America.
