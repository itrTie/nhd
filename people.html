        John Wilkes
    </h2>
    <p>
        While John Wilkes didn't influence adding the freedom of press to the first amendment, he did influence America to do so.
        Over in England, he challenged Parliment to add the freedom from arbitrary arrest to their laws, and freedom from getting arrested for members of Parliment.
        While it did pass, he was arrested but did get released due to his own laws as he was considered a member of Parliment.
