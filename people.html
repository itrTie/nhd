    <h2>
        John Wilkes
    </h2>
    <p>
        While John Wilkes did not add the freedom of press to the first amendment, he did influence America to do so.
        Over in England, he fought for the ability to publish verbatim accounts of parliamentary debates.

    <h2>
        Arthur Lee
    </h2>
    <p>
        Arthur Lee was a follower of Wilkes, and he also worked to get the freedom of the press.
        But, unlike Wilkes, he didn't work for things other than press-related topics.
